# ExileVehicleTraderCfgGenerator

The purpose of this Arma3 map save is to quickly create price/respect list for CfgTraders class for Arma 3 Exile Mod.

This project provides a modular system for calculating vehicle scores and respect levels in Arma 3, based on configurable vehicle parameters and armament data. It supports flexible scoring rules including defense, utility, mobility, cargo capacity, and armament types, with additional multipliers based on vehicle types.

## Features

- Calculates comprehensive total scores for vehicles using customizable parameters.
- Applies multipliers based on vehicle type (Car, Tank, Helicopter, Plane, Ship, Static).
- Modular and extendable armament classification to support cost and respect scoring.
- Debug logging for easier balancing and tuning.
- Designed with maintainability and extensibility in mind, leveraging reusable classification utilities.
- Lightweight and efficient SQF scripting compatible with Arma 3 mission and mod development.
#### More information will be added to Wiki in this repository

## Usage

- Integrate the scoring functions into your vehicle configuration workflows.
- Configure multipliers and scoring parameters via global arrays for easy tuning.
- Extend armament classification with new weapons or categories as needed.
- Optionally use debug mode for real-time logging of score calculations.
